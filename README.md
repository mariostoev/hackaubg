## Rules

Read more about the rules [here](https://github.com/mariostoev/hackaubg/blob/master/RULES.md). 

## Submissions 

All participants must submit their projects by opening an issue inside this repository. 

1. Your team is required to create a private GitHub repository containing all the files of your project. Both the back-end and front-end must be included in the repository. The jury must have the rights to view and edit your project in order to guide you and assess it at the end of the hackathon. 

2. The team leader of your group has to open up an Issue inside **this** repository before the deadline and by strictly following the issue template located [here](https://github.com/mariostoev/hackaubg/issues/1).

#### File and repository size limitations

To ensure both performance and reliability of both your team and the jury, we recommend that your projects size remains small, ideally less than 1GB, and less than 5GB is strongly recommended. After all, the duration of the Hackathon is two days and you are not supposed to deliver a finished project.
